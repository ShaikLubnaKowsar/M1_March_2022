## ABSTRACT

My project is about creating a dictionary. I am supposed to add modules for

1. Insertion of words

2. Deletion of words

3. Search for words

4. Display of dictionary

A dictionary is a collection of words in a preferred order.

We use the concepts of linked lists here to create a dictionary. Each word is connected
(linked) to atleast one word. Using this link, we can traverse among the words, whether to add,
delete, search or display words.

This dictionary that we created using linked lists can be further extended to create
alphabetically sorted dictionaries that can be accessed easily and quickly, which can
effectively replace physical dictionaries. This could be made a public-access dictionary using
webpages and internet connectivity.
